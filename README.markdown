MeDeList
========

This project aims to integrate a tagged to-do list with a time tracker.
I used many programs to do both, but some key functionality was always missing.


Main goals
----------

- Multiple clients specialized for different platforms (CLI,Gtk,Wpf)
- On-line and off-line mode
- Synchronize with/export to other calenders


WARNING!!!
----------

I do not honor the public repository, e.g. I may drop commits already pushed into it.
Please keep in mind, that this is a playground for me!

Once the projects hits a usable state, I will behave - promise.


Disclaimer
----------

This project is under lazy development! I work on it, if I have the time.

Everything is likely to change.
